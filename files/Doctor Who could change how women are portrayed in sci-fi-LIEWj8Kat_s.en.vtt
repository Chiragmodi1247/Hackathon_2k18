00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.760
These are Doctor Who fans — arguably some
of the most passionate fans of any show.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.740
And this year, they’re especially excited
because, for the first time in the show’s

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.780
55-year history, the Doctor won’t be played
by a white British man — it’ll be a woman.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.060
“Oh brilliant!”

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.000
This move adds Doctor Who to an influx of
sci-fi fantasy franchises who have already

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.840
put women at the helm.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.070
But this new woman Doctor is expected to have
a trait that those other heroines don’t

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.620
have — a sense of humor.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.100
“This is gonna be fun.”

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.750
For those of us not as invested in the show
as this guy — Doctor Who is the story of

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.489
a mysterious alien being (known as the Doctor)
who travels through time and space having

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.710
adventures and fighting evil.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.989
But the Doctor has one particularly special
ability — when the character is mortally

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.250
wounded, the doctor can regenerate into a
new body.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.560
The Doctor has had 13 different faces over
the years — all white, British men.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.520
This is one of the first episodes of Doctor
Who, from 1965...

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.250
The Doctor was an eccentric old man who often
relied on his more courageous companions to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.650
get him out of some sticky situations.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.170
Support me, dear boy.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.061
In fact, in early concept notes from one of
the show’s co-creators, the character of

00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:36.420
the Doctor was described as “a frail old
man lost in time and space.”

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.070
But as time went on, and different actors
rotated through the role, the Doctor went

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.390
from being a frail trickster to a male hero
archetype.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.800
The Third Doctor in particular played the
role as an “action hero”

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.700
“Violent exercise makes me hungry.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.810
Don’t you agree?”

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.140
Fast forward to the Tenth Doctor, and the
action hero traits had become baked into the

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.140
character...

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.760
“Leave this planet and never return — what
do you say?

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.420
Yes.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.120
All well then.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.620
Thanks for that!”

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.660
But there’s one particular personality trait
that stayed from the beginning...

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.460
The Doctor has a gleeful, almost childlike

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.460
personality.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.540
He’s a hero with a sense of humor - which
makes the character fun and compelling to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.040
watch.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.060
But that kind of character complexity has been

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.880
typically reserved for male heroes.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.240
Female superheroes are very much
pressured to be taken seriously because there

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.660
are so few of them, they have to do well.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.180
In 2014, the last time good data was available,
only 14% of mainstream sci-fi films had a woman

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.580
protagonist.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.930
Women are not only vastly underrepresented

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.560
in sci-fi fantasy films, they’re often
restricted to generic superhero personalities.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.579
If I think about the leading female
superhero... think about the Wonder Woman

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.020
film...She's powerful she's strong … But
she's not a funny funny character.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.660
She laughs, but doesn't crack jokes, she doesn't have banter in the

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.600
same way that male superheroes can do.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.620
That seriousness is consistent across most
woman characters on-screen.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.370
Take a look at this scene between Guardian
of the Galaxy’s heroine, Gamora, and one

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.800
of the film’s villains, Nebula.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.719
Gamora puts up a pretty awesome fight.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.880
But compare that to Peter, the film’s male
hero...

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.380
notice the difference?

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.919
There’s also Black Widow from The Avengers
whose whole personality is built around being

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.420
stoic.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.109
And Katniss Everdeen, who can do some serious
damage with a bow and arrow but barely ever

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.620
drops her steely persona.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.420
Of course, there are some examples of funny

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.590
heroines in film and television.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.540
One of the earliest is Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.659
These examples are still rare on-screen, but
there is one medium where heroines have more

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:14.889
complex personalities...

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.940
Female characters who do humor, do very well
in comics...

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.180
Squirrel Girl, Kamala Khan, Gwen Pool.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.560
From a financial point of view, it is less
of a risk.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.680
Because there's less of a pressure

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.840
on a female-led title to do well, there's more
room for comedy, there's more room for humor.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.020
It’s this scarcity of women superheroes
in film and television that makes the new

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.650
female Doctor’s role even more impactful.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.740
This woman doctor is not only expected to
be a great witty hero traveling through space

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.479
like her male predecessors, she could also
push the boundaries of what a woman hero can

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.100
be...

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.560
To have a female Doctor, that's a win for
a lot of us.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.760
Women, young girls will get to see someone

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.220
that looks like them

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.940
be smart and interesting and funny and that
is incredibly important.

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.909
So even if you’re not one of the millions
of people worldwide who watches Doctor Who,

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.340
next time you see an awesome new woman superhero,
you might have the Doctor to thank.
